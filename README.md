# AbandonedForrest
![](assets/Slender%20the%20Game.png)

**Description**: Remember that 2012 game, "Slender: The Eight Pages"? My generative world tries to imitate the abandoned buildings deep in a dark forrest, similar in the game minus a lanky faceless man chasing you.

**Codes**: You can change the world using the `reseed` button or by editing the map editor. The `b` represents abandoned buildings, the `w` represents the walkway between the two buildings, and the `_` (underscore symbol) represents the dark forest littered with trees.

**Life**: Blue particles animation to add the dreariness of the lonely forrest.
